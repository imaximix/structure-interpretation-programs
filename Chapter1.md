Building Abstractions with Procedures

**Computational Processes** are abstract beings that live inside our computers.

As *Processes* evolve they manipulate abstract things called **Data**. Their evolution is directed by a pattern of rules called a **Program**.
*People create programs to direct processes*

Why Lisp? Because *Procedures as Data*.
Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.
