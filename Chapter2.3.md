### 2.3.1 Quotation
Just like natural languages we need a way to deferentiate between sematic and syntactic.
In natural languages we use 'word' to turn semantic to syntactic. 
E.g. 
"Tell me your name" => All words are semantic, you would expect to hear "John"
"Tell me 'your name'" => the words between to '' are to be interpreted as is (syntactic), you would hear "your name"
